		<h1><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
		KE Text (Knowledge E Text, where the E stands for Editing, which is historically correct, or Entry, which is intuitively correct) is an ASCII text format for specifying changes to a Cyc KB. The text is parsed into KB operations (asserts, unasserts, renames, etc.) that are then evaluated. KE Text is processed through the browser through the Compose KE Text page, which allows typing in KE Text.<p>
The KE Text facilities allow authors to compose a set of KB changes in
text and add them to a Cyc KB in a single batch operation.
Choosing to use KE Text is strictly a matter of convenience.
Operations entered using KE Text do not differ in the KB from those
entered via other browser tools.  Most users find it convenient in
situations where many similar changes need to be made or when they are
adding a related set of new constants and assertions.
<p>

<H1><A NAME="Syntax">KE Text Syntax</A></H1>

KE Text syntax is just a syntactic/notational variation of <A
HREF="glossary.html#CycL">CycL</A>.  Many people find it easier
and faster to write some types of CycL expressions using KE Text
syntax than using "canonical" FOPC-in-Lisp CycL syntax, which
partly explains why KE Text syntax continues to be supported by
knowledge entry tools.

<dd>

<A HREF="glossary.html#variable">Variables</A> occurring anywhere
in a KE text (e.g., inside <A HREF="glossary.html#rule">rule</A>
statements) must begin with a question mark (?). This convention
signals the knowledge entry facilities to treat the object as a
variable, rather than as a <A HREF="glossary.html#constant">
constant</A>.

<dt><H3><A NAME="Constants">Constants</A></H3>
<dd>

It is not necessary to include the initial "#$" in references to
known <A HREF="glossary.html#constant">constants</A> (i.e.,
constants which Cyc already knows to exist), though it is
not disallowed.  For example, one could use either #$Siegel or
Siegel; #$KeithsHouse or KeithsHouse.  Accepted practice is to
write KE text without the "#$" prefix.

<dt><H3><A NAME="Strings">Strings</A></H3>
<dd>

Strings referred to in KE text (such as entries on the <a
href=/cycdoc/vocab/doc-vocab.html#comment>#$comment</a> predicate
for a constant) must be delimited by double quotes (e.g., "This
is a string."), as in Common Lisp and C.
<p>
To use double quotes inside comments, prefix them with a backslash.  (e.g. "This comment \"contains\" double quotes.")
<p>KE text preserves tab and return/newline/linefeed characters that occur inside strings, but will remove any non-printing characters.
<dt><H3><A NAME="Keywords">Keywords</A></H3>
<dd>

Keywords occuring in formulas must be prefixed with a colon.
(e.g. "f: (genKeyword PublicConstant :PUBLIC-CONSTANT).")

<dt><H3><A NAME="Symbols">Symbols</A></H3>
<dd>

Symbols occuring in formulas must be prefixed with a single
quote.  (e.g. "f: (afterAdding genls 'GENLS-AFTER-ADDING).")

</dl>

<H2><A NAME="Expressions">Expressions</A></H2><p>

A complete, meaningful syntactic unit of Cyc KE text is
an "expression". Expressions in KE Text syntax are somewhat analogous
to sentences in a natural language, or more closely, to expressions in
a programming language such as Lisp or C. In C, the end of an
expression is indicated by a semi-colon (;). In Lisp, the end of an
expression is indicated by a right parenthesis that balances a
corresponding left parenthesis. In KE Text syntax, each expression
must end with a period (.), and the period must be outside of a
comment or a string. The general form of an expression in KE Text
syntax is as follows: <p>

<pre>
&lt;directive&gt;: &lt;data-object-or-object-sequence&gt;.
</pre>

<H2><A NAME="Directives">Directives</A></H2><p>

There are two types of objects which may fill the &lt;directive&gt;
position in a KE text expression: reserved words and <A
HREF="glossary.html#predicate">predicates</A>.  <p>


<H3><A NAME="Reserved Words">Reserved Words</A></H3>


The first type comprises reserved words (analogous 
to reserved words in a programming language), 
which are as follows:
<p>

<UL>
  <LI><a href="#Constant">Constant</a>
  <LI><a href="#InMt">In Mt</a>
  <li><a href="#DefaultMt">Default Mt</a>
  <LI><a href="#TruthValue">Truth Value (or TV)</a>
  <LI><a href="#Direction">Direction (or D)</a>
  <LI><a href="#Formula">Formula</a>
  <li><a href="#Enter">Enter</a>
  <li><a href="#Delete">Delete</a>
  <li><a href="#Rename">Rename</a>
  <li><a href="#Kill">Kill</a>
</UL>

The syntax for all reserved words except Enter, Delete, and
Rename is the same.  Each reserved word is followed by a colon
delimiter, exactly one data object, and a period. That is, the
form of a reserved word expression in KE Text syntax is:
<p>

<pre>
     &lt;reserved-word&gt;: &lt;data-object&gt;.
</pre>
<p>

Note that reserved word directive names are not case-sensitive.  
For example, "constant" works just as well as "Constant".
<p>

Enter and Delete have the following syntax:
<p>
<pre>
     &lt;reserved-word&gt;.
</pre>
<p>

Rename has the following syntax:
<p>
<pre>
     &lt;reserved-word&gt;: &lt;old-constant-name&gt; &lt;new-name-string&gt;.
</pre>
<p>

<H4><A NAME="Constant">Constant</A></H4>


If the reserved word is "Constant", the data object
following the colon delimiter must be the name of a Cyc <A
HREF="glossary.html#constant">constant</A> (e.g., Pittman, or
MarksHouse, or some other Cyc constant).  For example:<p>

<pre>
     Constant: Pittman.
     Constant: Murray.
</pre><p>If the data object following the colon delimiter is not already known (by Cyc) to be a Cyc constant, the user will be asked if he/she wants to create a new constant with that name. <p>

When an expression beginning with a Constant directive is evaluated,
it causes the default entry constant (the "current" constant) to be
set to the named constant, the
default <A HREF="glossary.html#tv">truth value</A> to be set to
:unknown, the default <A HREF="glossary.html#direction">
direction</A> to also be set to :unknown, and the default entry <A
HREF="glossary.html#mt">microtheory</A> to be set to the BaseKB.  The 
only exception to this is if the microtheory has previously been set via 
the <a href="#DefaultMt">Default Mt</a> directive, in which case the use
of the Constant directive leaves the microtheory unchanged.  All of the 
settings made by the Constant directive persist until they
are changed by some other (implicit or explicit) directive.  
<p>

<H4><A NAME="InMt">In Mt</A></H4><p>

If the reserved word is "In Mt", the data object following the colon
delimiter must be a known (i.e., already existing) <A
HREF="glossary.html#mt">microtheory</A>.<p>

Example:
<p>

In Mt: HumanActivitiesMt.<p>

When an expression beginning with an In Mt directive is evaluated, it
causes the default entry microtheory to be set to the named
microtheory. This setting persists until the next occurrence of an In
Mt directive, a Default Mt directive, or a Constant directive. <p>

<h4><a name="DefaultMt">Default Mt</a></h4>

If the reserved word is "Default Mt", the data object
following the colon delimiter must be a known (i.e., already
existing) microtheory.  For example:
<pre>
    Default Mt: HumanActivitiesMt.
</pre>
When an expression beginning with a Default Mt directive is
evaluated, is causes the entry/delete microtheory to be set
to the named microtheory.  This setting persists until the
next occurrence of a Default Mt or In Mt directive, or the
end of the file/text being processed.  Once a directive has been
overriden by another directive, the scope of the original directive is
no longer valid, even if the second directive is itself overriden
later.  Note that this directive, unlike the In Mt directive,
prevents each occurrence of a Constant directive from
resetting the default microtheory to BaseKB.  This directive
makes it easier to process all (or most) of
the expressions in a file/text segment in the same microtheory.
     
<H4><A NAME="TruthValue">Truth Value</A></H4><p>

If the reserved word is "Truth Value" (or "TV"), the data object
following the colon delimiter must be one of the keywords :default,
:monotonic, or :unknown.  (It's also OK to omit the colon).  <p>

(Check the glossary for a quick description of the difference between
<A HREF="glossary.html#default true">default true</A> and <A
HREF="glossary.html#monotonically true">monotonically true</A>.)  <p>

Examples:<p>

<pre>
     Truth Value: :monotonic.
     TV: monotonic.
</pre><p>

It should only very rarely be necessary for a user to use a Truth
Value directive.  KE Text assigns truth values to entry expressions
automatically.  If an entry expression begins with a <A
HREF="glossary.html#predicate">predicate</A> which is an instance of
DefaultMonotonicPredicate (including isa and genls), the
expression is automatically assigned a truth value of :monotonic.  All
other entry expressions are automatically assigned a truth value of
:default.  <p>

<b>The only reason to use a Truth Value directive is if you want to
override these built-in defaults.</b> <p>

When an expression beginning with a Truth Value directive is
evaluated, it causes the entry truth value for the following
expression to be set to the indicated truth value.  (Note that an
expression might comprise several assertions.  This will be explained
more fully below).  After the expression to be entered is evaluated,
the setting immediately reverts to :unknown, until the next entry
expression is encountered (and the truth value is automatically set to
:default or :monotonic), or until another Truth Value directive is
read.  <p>

When would you want to use this directive?  Suppose you wanted to
enter a <A HREF="glossary.html#rule">rule</A> with a truth value of
:monotonic.  Since the default setting for rules is :default, in your
KE text you would want to precede the rule with this expression: <p>

Truth Value: :monotonic.<p>

<H4><A NAME="Direction">Direction</A></H4><p>

If the reserved word is "Direction" (or "D"), the data object
following the colon delimiter must be one of the keywords :forward (to
indicate <A HREF="glossary.html#forward">forward</A> propagation),
:backward (to indicate <A HREF="glossary.html#backward">backward</A>
propagation), or :unknown.  (It's also OK to omit the colon).  <p>

Examples:
<p>
<pre>
     Direction: :forward.
     d: backward.
</pre>
<p>

KE Text assigns <A HREF="glossary.html#direction">directions</A> to
entry expressions automatically.  Expressions beginning with a simple
<A HREF="glossary.html#predicate">predicate</A> (<A
HREF="glossary.html#GAF">ground atomic formulas</A>) are assigned a
direction of :forward.  All other entry expressions (most notably, all
<A HREF="glossary.html#rule">rules</A>) are assigned a direction of
:backward.  <p>

<b>The only reason to use a Direction directive is if you want to
override these built-in defaults.</b> <p>

When an expression beginning with a Direction directive is evaluated,
it causes the direction for the following entry expression to be set
to the indicated direction.  After the expression to be entered is
read, the setting immediately reverts to :unknown, until the next
entry expression is encountered or another Direction directive is
read.  <p>

The most common use for this directive is to enter <A
HREF="glossary.html#rule">rules</A> with a direction of :forward.<p>

<H4><A NAME="Formula">Formula</A></H4><p>

If the reserved word is "F" (for "formula"), the data object
following the colon delimiter must be a well-formed <A
HREF="glossary.html#CycLForm">CycL Formula</A>.  <p>

The <A HREF="glossary.html#constant">constants</A> referred to in the
CycL formula must already be known to
Cyc (i.e., must already exist, perhaps as a result of being created at
some previous point in the KE text).  <p>

(KE Text will also accept the directive "EL" to specify a <A
HREF="glossary.html#CycLForm">CycL Formula</A>.  "EL" stands for 
"<a href="glossary.html#EL">Epistemological Level</a>", as distinct
from "HL", which stands for "<A HREF="glossary.html#HL">Heuristic
Level</A>".)  <p>

Examples:<p>

<pre>
     F: (implies
	    (isa ?cat Tiger)
	    (hasVisibleSurfacePatternType ?cat StripedPattern)). 

     F:  (holdsIn (Year 1995) (owns Goolsbey KeithsHouse)).

     F: (likesAsFriend SimoneSiegel KathyBurns).
</pre>
<p>

<h4><a name="Enter">Enter</a></h4>
If the reserved word is "Enter", it must be followed by a
period.  All of the expressions following this reserved word
until an occurrence of the reserved word "Delete" (or the
end of the file/text) will be processed assuming that the
resulting assertions should be entered into the Cyc KB.
For example:
<pre>
    Enter.

    F : (holdsIn (Year 1995) (owns Goolsbey KeithsHouse)).
</pre>The default processing mode for the KE Text facilitiy (Compose) is entry mode, so you don't have to use this reserved word unless you want to start entering assertions after a region of text in which the processing mode was set to delete (see below).


<h4><a name="Delete">Delete</a></h4>

If the reserved word is "Delete", it must be followed by a
period.  All of the expressions following this reserved word
until an occurrence of the reserved word "Enter" (or the
end of the file/text) will be processed assuming that the
resulting assertions should be removed from the Cyc KB.
For example:
<pre>
    Delete.

    F: (holdsIn (Year 1996) (owns Goolsbey KeithsOldCar)).

    Enter.

    F: (holdsIn (Year 1996) (owns Goolsbey KeithsNewCar)).
</pre>
Since the default processing mode for the KE Text facilities
(KE File, Compose) is entry mode, you must use use the
"Delete" reserved word if you want to remove assertions from
the Cyc KB by processing KE Text.  If the assertion to be
removed is a local assertion, the method (FI function) used
is KE-UNASSERT.  If the assertion to be removed is a remote
assertion, the method used is KE-BLAST.  Exercise caution in
using this directive.

<h4><a name="Rename">Rename</a></h4>

If the reserved word is "Rename", the colon delimiter must
be followed by a constant name, a string indicating the new
name, and a period.  For example:
<pre>
    Rename: NicksFirstKid "SimoneSiegel".
</pre>The Rename directive provides a convenient way to do a batch of constant renames in text.<p>
A renamed
constant does not become the "current" constant.

<h4><a name="Kill">Kill</a></h4> If the reserved word is "Kill",
the colon delimiter must be followed by the name of the constant
to be killed.  For example:

		<pre>
    Kill: highestVolcanoInRegion.

</pre>
		<dt>
		<H3><A NAME="Predicate Directives">Predicate Directives</A></H3><p>
<dd>

The second type of directive comprises Cyc <A
HREF="glossary.html#predicate">predicates</A> occurring within the
scope of a (previously occurring) Constant directive.  The Constant
directive sets the "current" <A
HREF="glossary.html#constant">constant</A>, which then is understood
to be the first <A HREF="glossary.html#argument">argument</A> to <A
HREF="glossary.html#assertion">assertions</A> generated from the
following predicate directive expressions.  <p>

(Note that predicate directive names, unlike reserved word directive
names, are case-sensitive.  After all, a predicate directive name is
just the name of a CycL predicate, and CycL constant names are
case-sensitive.)  <p>

Each predicate directive is followed by a colon delimiter, one or 
more data objects, and a period. That is, the form of a 
predicate expression in KE Text syntax is 
<p>

<pre>
&lt;predicate&gt;: &lt;data-object-1&gt; [&lt;data-object-2&gt;...&lt;data-object-n&gt;].
</pre>
<p>

The data objects following the colon delimiter comprise the additional
argument(s) to the predicate in the predicate directive.  <p>

Example:
<p>
<pre>
     Constant: Goolsbey.
     isa: HumanCyclist ElectricalEngineer.
     feelsTowardsObject: (SimoneSiegel Affection Positive)
			 (BillJ Curiosity Positive).
     comment: "Keith Goolsbey is a member of the Cycorp technical board.". 
</pre>

In this example, the Constant directive sets the "current" constant to
be Goolsbey. Goolsbey is then assumed to be the first argument to
assertions formed from the three following predicate directive
expressions (the expressions which begin with "isa",
"feelsTowardsObject", and "comment").  <p>

If the predicate directive is the name of a <A
HREF="glossary.html#arity">binary</A> predicate (such as isa
and comment), each of the data objects following the colon delimiter
is assumed to be part of an assertion in which the predicate directive
is the predicate, the default constant is the first argument, and the
data object is the second argument.  <p>

If the predicate directive is the name of an <A
HREF="glossary.html#arity">n-ary</A> predicate where n is greater than
2 (such as <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/emotion-vocab.html#feelsTowardsObject>#$feelsTowardsObject</a>), each of the data objects following the
colon delimiter must be a list.  The elements in the list are assumed
to be part of an assertion in which the predicate directive is the
predicate, the default constant is the first argument, and the
elements (in listed order) are the remaining arguments. So, when
evaluated and processed, the KE text fragment in the example above
would result in the addition of the following six assertions to the
KB: <p>

<pre>
     (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> #$Goolsbey #$HumanCyclist)
     (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> #$Goolsbey #$ElectricalEngineer)
     (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/emotion-vocab.html#feelsTowardsObject>#$feelsTowardsObject</a> #$Goolsbey #$SimoneSiegel <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/emotion-vocab.html#Affection>#$Affection</a> #$Positive)
     (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/emotion-vocab.html#feelsTowardsObject>#$feelsTowardsObject</a> #$Goolsbey #$BillJ #$Curiosity #$Positive)
     (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/doc-vocab.html#comment>#$comment</a> #$Goolsbey "Keith Goolsbey is a member of the Cycorp technical board.")
</pre>

Note that because any number of data objects may follow a colon
delimiter preceded by a predicate directive, one KE text expression
may result in several assertions being added to the <A
HREF="glossary.html#KB">knowledge base</A>.  Any reserved word
directive immediately preceding such a compound KE text expression
(i.e., an expression yielding more than one assertion) will apply to
<I>all</I> of the assertions resulting from the expression.  <p>

Also, note that since a "canonical" <A
HREF="glossary.html#CycLForm">CycL Formula</A> 
can be entered in KE text by using the F directive,
the assertions resulting from the expressions in the example above are
exactly the same as the assertions resulting from the expressions in
the example immediately below.  <p>

Example:
<p>
<pre>
     F: (isa Goolsbey HumanCyclist).
     F: (isa Goolsbey ElectricalEngineer).
     F: (feelsTowardsObject Goolsbey SimoneSiegel Affection Positive).
     F: (feelsTowardsObject Goolsbey BillJ Curiosity Positive).
     F: (comment Goolsbey "Keith Goolsbey is a member of the Cycorp technical board."). <p>
</pre>
<p>

If Cyc had the unary predicate "dog", indicating membership in the
class of all dogs (or the quality of "dogness"), assertions using this
predicate could be entered with an expression such as this: <p>

<pre>
     dog: Brandy .
     F: (dog Brandy) .
</pre>


<H2><A NAME="Comments">Comments in KE Text</A></H2><p>

Comments (text to be read by a human, but not interpreted or entered
by a program) are allowed in KE text. The comment indicator is the
semi-colon (;), as in Common Lisp. Lines beginning with a semi-colon
will be ignored. More precisely, any sequence of characters following
a semi-colon (and including the semi-colon) up until the next
occurrence of a return (line-break, line-feed) character will be
ignored, except when the semi-colon occurs inside a string (a
character sequence delimited by double quotes) which is not itself
inside a comment.  <p>

<H2><A NAME="Order">Order of Expressions</A></H2><p>

Expressions in KE text are evaluated and processed in the order of
their occurrence in the text. In general, it's a good idea to write KE
text expressions about a constant only after the point where a
Constant directive for that constant occurs (unless, of course, the
constant is already known to Cyc).  <p>

<H2><A NAME="Example">Another Example</A></H2><p>

<pre>
Constant: BillJones.
isa: HumanCyclist CulturalAnthropologist.

In Mt: NaiveBiologicalDescentMt.
children: JenniferJones.

In Mt: LanguageAndWritingSystemMt.
Direction: :forward.
F: (implies
        (languageSpoken ?person EasternPahariLanguage)
        (likesAsFriend BillJones ?person)).
</pre>

Evaluation of the expressions above would result in the four
assertions being added to the Cyc KB.  In the BaseKB, we would have:
<p>

<pre>
(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> #$BillJones #$HumanCyclist)
(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> #$BillJones #$CulturalAnthropologist) 
</pre>

In the NaiveBiologicalDescentMt, we would have:
<p>
<pre>
(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#children>#$children</a> #$BillJones #$JenniferJones)
</pre>

And in the LanguageAndWritingSystemMt, with direction 
:forward (forward propagation), we would have:
<p>
		<pre>
(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/linguistic-vocab.html#languageSpoken>#$languageSpoken</a> ?person #$EasternPahariLanguage)
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#likesAsFriend>#$likesAsFriend</a> #$BillJones ?person))

<H2><A NAME="ke-text-web">Processing KE Text in the Cyc Web Interface</A></H2>The Cyc Web Interface provides a facility for processing KE Text called the Compose page. It may be accessed from the &quot;KE-File&quot; section of the Cyc Navigator page or from the Tools menu.

confirmation.

If the changes are confirmed, the operations are queued for processing
on the Cyc Server Machine.

		<h1><a name="appendix-a">Appendix A: KE Text History</a></h1>
		

KE Text syntax is just a syntactic/notational variation of <A
HREF="glossary.html#CycL">CycL</A>.  To some extent, it is a holdover
from when Cyc was a <A
HREF="glossary.html#frame-based">frame-based</A> system and CycL was a
frame-based language. Many people find it easier and faster to write
some types of CycL expressions using KE Text syntax than using
"canonical" FOPC-in-Lisp CycL syntax, which partly explains why
KE Text syntax continues to be supported by knowledge entry tools.
<p>
There are some aliases for directives which are retained for
backward compatibility with files written for older versions of
KE Text:
<ul>
			<li>Unit = Constant
  <li>Access Level or AL = Direction
  <ul>
  <li>0 = :forward
<li>4 = :backward
</ul>
  <li>EL = Formula
</ul>
		<p>
In the past you could not include references to a
constant in a file/text if the constant appears in a kill
expression earlier in the file/text.  This would cause problems
when the resulting kill expressions are processed by the Cyc
Agenda, since the following expressions would reference what is
now a dead (non-existent) constant.
