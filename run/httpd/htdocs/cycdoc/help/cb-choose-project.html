<h3><a name="projects">KE Projects</a></h3>
<p>
Knowledge entry work at Cycorp is often done under a particular entry
mode, or project, to help detemine where certain knowledge falls
within the CYC&reg; ontology.  However, these projects are for Cycorp
internal uses only, and releases of the CYC&reg; System may or may not
use one or more Cyc-Based Project as a guideline for determining the
content of the release, but finished releases will very likely diverge
from this guideline, in the manner of additions, subtractions,
refinements, and more.
<p>
The project currently selected is listed after the "Current Project" link in the Login Area in the Toolbar frame at the top of the screen.  The default value is "General Cyc KE", meaning that the knowledge entry done will not be attributed to any specific project.  The projects available for choosing are listed on the Choose KE Project page, which can be reached by clicking on the "Current Project" link.  Clicking on the name of any project in this list will take you the KB Browser display for that constant, where the <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/doc-vocab.html#comment>#$comment</a> will give an explanation of how and when it is to be used.
<p>
