<h3><a name="show-synset">Show Selected Synset</a></h3>

<p> This page displays the synset you have selected. Generalizations of that synset (called "hypernyms" in WordNet) are displayed, followed by specializations of the synset (called "hyponyms" in WordNet). If other related synsets are available, they are shown as well (for example, synsets standing in the part-of or "meronym" relation to the selected one).<p>

Here, as well, a synset followed by a Cyc term means that a link already exists between the two. If you are viewing a synset which is already linked, you have the option of editing or deleting that link. If you are viewing a synset which is not yet linked to a Cyc term, you have the option of adding a link. Cyc will frequently provide suggestions as to which Cyc constant is appropriate for linking to a particular synset. If you agree with one of the suggestions, you can click on the button beside it.<p>

Clicking on "Show Alignment" at the top of the page causes Cyc to examine all hyponyms of the current synset, and list ones which are currently unlinked. It also looks at specs/instances of the current Cyc term, and lists ones which are currently unlinked.

<p>Clicking on the name of any Cyc constant will take you to the Browser page for that constant.


<p>NOTE: in the OpenCyc release, the [Add to Lexicon] link will not work.<p>
