Background</A>
</H1>

<P>
Currently at Cycorp, concepts are labelled in a two phase process.
First, when the knowledge engineer is creating a concept, a phrase is
associated with the concept using a #$termStrings assertion.
This is suitable for retrieving the concept using the same phrase, but
doesn't allow for recognition of simple variants, for example, those
based on pluralization.  Furthermore, these labels are not suitable for
generation purposes where the form might change based on the context
(e.g., 'how to swim' vs. 'swimming advice'). Thus, there is a second
phase in which the plain labels are converted into lexical assertions,
which encode syntactic information suitable for recognizing variants and
proper generation. Such assertions are generally only made by the NL
staff, although KE'ers with substantial experience can also make
them. Thus there is a bottleneck is the process of ensuring that proper
``lexifications'' are associated with Cyc concepts.

<P>
As a first step in addressing this problem, the Open Directory linking
tool introduced a lexical wizard that guided the users in the decisions
that needed to be made when performing the lexification and made the
appropriate assertions for them.  However, this is only applicable for
concepts created during external concept linking.  Also, only a limited
range of lexifications were supported..

<P>

Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
The Cycorp Lexification Wizard is extension of the Open Directory
linking tool lexification wizard that is integrated into the browser.
The interface is designed to have the feel of a Microsoft Windows based
wizard. In particular, options can be specified one at a time with the
next phase invoked via a  N<SMALL>EXT</SMALL>-&gt;button. Defaults will be filled in
based on the selection and then the same page brought up for further
input.  When the tool has determined the settings for all options needed
forthe lexification, a  L<SMALL>EXIFY </SMALL>button will replace the next
button. After the proposed assertion is diagnosed OK, the  F<SMALL>INISH </SMALL>
button will appear, signalling that the actual assertion can be made.

General Lexification</A>
</H1>

<P>
For all terms to be lexified, the following options need to be
specified.

<P>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3 BORDER="1">

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
Proper Name Lexification</A>
</H1>

<P>
Proper name lexification involves selecting a predicate that best
expresses the relationship of a name to a Cyc constant. Often this will
just be #$nameString, unless a specialization is more
appropriate (e.g., #$scientificName). Therefore, there is a
single option to be selected in this case:

<P>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3 BORDER="1">
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Proper-name-predicate</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH=360>Name of the predicate to use (see #$properNameStrings)</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">
Denotational Lexification</A>
</H1>

<P>
``Denotational'' lexification involves selecting options needed for a
#$denotation or one of the multi-word lexification predicates
(e.g., #$multiWordString). The relevant options follow:

<P>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3 BORDER="1">
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Headword position</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH=360>Position in the phrase of the headword (i.e.,
the word that determines the grammatic function of the entire phrase)</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Headword part of speech</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH=360>Grammatical part of speech of the
headword (see #$SpeechPart).</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Often selecting between the #$SimpleNoun and #$MassNoun
parts of speech is not straightforward. For tips on making this
decision, see <A NAME="tex2html1"
 HREF="file://localhost/cyc/projects/od/gen-info/odFAQ.htm#massSimple">file://localhost/cyc/projects/od/gen-info/odFAQ.htm#massSimple</A>.

<P>
Whenever the selected headword for a phrase being lexified doesn't have
an entry in the Cyc Lexicon, the ``No suitable parts of speech'' error
message will be displayed and the  A<SMALL>DD </SMALL>M<SMALL>APPING</SMALL> button will be
shown to allow the syntactic information to be added via Wales.  For
documentation using Wales for this purpose, see
<A NAME="tex2html2"

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00060000000000000000">
Relation Lexification</A>
</H1>

<P>
During lexification of relation terms, the term itself is not lexified,
since relations are only of interest when instantiated. Instead,
relational lexification involves creating a #$genFormat
statement which indicates how a particular instance of a relation along
with the arguments can be paraphrased into English. The relevant options
follow:

<P>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3 BORDER="1">
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Relation template</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH=360>Template for relational lexifications (via #$genFormat)</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Argument specification</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH=360>Argument specification for the relational template</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Skip arity checks?</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH=360>Whether to bypass the relation arity checks</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
An introduction to the use of #$genFormat can be found in
<A NAME="tex2html3"
 HREF="file:////home/baxter/cvs/head/cycorp/cyc/doc/ref/generation.text">file:////home/baxter/cvs/head/cycorp/cyc/doc/ref/generation.text</A>.

<P>
Keywords commonly used in the argument specifications:

<P>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3 BORDER="1">
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">:quote</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Use concept name rather than NL paraphrase</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">:plural-generic</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Use a plural noun form</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">:singular-generic</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Use a singular noun form</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">:mass-number-generic</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Use a mass (aka non-count) noun form such as 'sand'</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">:non-plural-generic</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Use either a mass or a singular form</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">:non-singular-generic</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Use either a mass or a plural form</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">:a</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Include the determiner 'a' or 'an' as appropriate</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">:the</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Include the determiner 'the'</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">:gerund</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Use a progressive verb form such as 'walking'</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
The following points should be kept in mind:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>The <EM>phrase</EM> option is currently ignored

<P>
<LI>Only select <EM>Skip arity checks?</EM> when really confident.

<P>
This option is a temporary workaround until more sophisticated checks
are implemented for ensuring that the template corresponds to the
argument specifications.

<P>
<LI>Do not add determiners (e.g., 'a') in the relation template. 

<P>
Determiner words should not be placed in the relation template. For example,
<PRE>
    (genFormat genls 'a ~a is a ~a' (1 2))
</PRE>Instead, the determiner keywords should be used, such as :a or :the.
<PRE>
    (genFormat genls '~a is ~a' ((1 :a :singular-generic) (2 :a :singular-generic)))
</PRE>
