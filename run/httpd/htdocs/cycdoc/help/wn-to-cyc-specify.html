<h3><a name="diagnose-formula">WordNet-Cyc Linking Tool</a></h3>

<p>WordNet is very large English lexical database in which words are organized into synonym sets, or "synsets". Many existing natural language processing systems make use of the WordNet database. Separate lexicons, ontologies, etc. may be able to "talk to" one another if they are both linked to WordNet; WordNet can act as a sort of interlingua in such cases.<p>

Relations among synsets (e.g. hypernym, antonym, meronym) are provided by WordNet, and synsets are organized into hierarchies. This tool allows users to state links between WordNet synsets and Cyc constants. The interface also allows the user to browse WordNet, and to see existing Cyc-WordNet links. To begin, enter a word in the typein box, select the appropriate part of speech, and hit "View Word". You may also search for a synset via its numerical ID string.<p>

Links between Cyc and WordNet are encoded using the predicate <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/info-vocab.html#synonymousExternalConcept>#$synonymousExternalConcept</a>, and are stored in the <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/lexicon-vocab.html#WordNetMappingMt>#$WordNetMappingMt</a>.

<p> As an example, enter "bat" in the box, select Noun, and hit "View Word."
