<h3><a name="show-synset">Show Alignment</a></h3>

Since the Cyc ontology and WordNet database have a tree-like structure, the Show Alignment tool can start at any particular node in WordNet, and travel downwards, looking for any synset which is not yet linked to a Cyc constant. Similarly, it begins at the corresponding node in the Cyc ontology and travels downward, looking for constants which are not yet linked to WordNet synsets.<p>
