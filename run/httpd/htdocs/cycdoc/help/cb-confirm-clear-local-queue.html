<hr>

<p> Since clearing the local queue will cause all operations in the
queue to be discarded without being processed, and may result in loss
of work, a confirmation is built into the system.

<p> To keep the local queue intact and return to the previous page,
press the [<i>No</i>] button.

<p> To go ahead and delete the entire queue, press the [<i>Yes, Clear
Local Queue</i>] button.

<p> If you want to keep a record of the operations in the local queue
(e.g., to try running them again at some later time), press the
[<i>No</i>] button to return to the previous page.  Then view the
contents of the local queue and copy some or all of the operations to
a text file.
