1. Introduction</A>
</H1>
Traditionally at Cycorp, the process of creating new terms (i.e.,
constants or narts) involved work by two separate groups. First, the
concept is created along definitional assertions and comments by someone
in the Ontological Engineering (OE) department. Afterwards, lexical
mappings are added by some in the Natural Language (NL) group.

These two steps have been separated because sometimes adding these
lexical mappings, which we call <EM>lexifications</EM>, can involve
linguistic considerations that OE'rs might not have in general. 
The <EM>Dictionary Assistant</EM>
<A NAME="tex2html2"
 HREF="#foot124"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
shields the user from the technical considerations by explaining the
choices in a nontechnical manner. It is designed to let whoever creates
a term also handle the lexical mappings, thus streamlining the overall
term-creation process.

<P>
This manual is organized as follows: Section <A HREF="sme-lexwiz.html#starting-tool">2</A>
explains how to start up the tool.
Section <A HREF="sme-lexwiz.html#lexification-steps">3</A> provides details on the specific questions
that the assistant asks.
Finally, section <A HREF="sme-lexwiz.html#sample-interaction">4</A> for a sample interaction using
the tool.

2. Starting the tool
</H1>

<P>
The Dictionary Assistant is available from the Tools menu, but it is
usually easier to invoke it from the <EM>Cyc Browser</EM>. For the current
Cyc term, the assistant can be started by first displaying the <B>Lexical Info</B> page and then clicking the <B>[Lexify]</B> link at the
bottom of the page.  (The [Lexify] link will also be shown on the
browser for any unlexified term.)  This will bring up the tool start-up
page with the term and a default phrase for referring to the term, based
on the term's label. For example, the phrase for AdHocUnit-Military will
be "ad hoc unit - military".

<P>
Tips on selecting the phrase will be shown in a 'Tip:' section. In
addition, the term documentation and definitional information will be
shown in the bottom of the page to help with the phrase selection.
After changing the phrase (e.g., "ad hoc military unit"), the user
should select OK to proceed with the lexification. This will lead to a
series of non-technical questions that the user needs to answer to
complete the lexification. Each question is shown on a separate page
that usually also includes a tips section at the bottom providing more
information on making the decision.

<P>

3. Lexification steps
</H1>

<P>
The Dictionary Assistant guides the user in making the decisions
necessary for proper lexification as terms. It presents the user with
simple nontechnical questions in order to determine the parameters
needed for making the lexical assertions. This section provides details
on the questions that the Dictionary Assistant needs to
determined. These questions determine the lexification parameters needed
for the underlying assertions.

<P>
The questions are organized into four groups. There is one group common
to all lexifications (section <A HREF="sme-lexwiz.html#general">3.1</A>); and, there are separate
groups for each of the main types of lexical assertions supported:
proper-name mappings (section <A HREF="sme-lexwiz.html#proper-name">3.2</A>), denotational mappings
(section <A HREF="sme-lexwiz.html#denotational">3.3</A>), and lexical assertions for paraphrasing
relations (section <A HREF="sme-lexwiz.html#relational">3.4</A>).

3.1 General Lexification
</H2>

<P>
For all terms to be lexified, the following options need to be
determined.

<P>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3 BORDER="1">
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Term</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH=360>The Cyc concept to be lexified</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Phrase</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH=360>A word or phrase serving as a label for the term</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Is proper noun?</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH=360>Whether the phrase is a proper name</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Is preferred?</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH=360>Whether the phrase the most suitable form of reference</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
The first two (<I>Term</I> and <I>Phrase</I>) are specified on the initial screen.
An error message will be displayed if the term is invalid or if the
phrase if empty. Once the term is known, it's comments and definition
assertions will be shown at the bottom of the screen, which can be
helpful in selecting a phrase for the lexical mapping.

<P>
The next option (
<!-- MATH: $Is proper noun?$ -->
<I>Is proper noun</I>?) determines whether the lexical
mappings should use proper-name type assertions (e.g.,
#$nameString) versus one of the other semantic assertions (e.g.,
#$multiWordString). This often can be determined based on the
type of type of term (e.g., instances of #$Individual generally
use proper-name lexical mappings). But the question will be asked
regardless to avoid overgeneralization.

<P>
The last general option (
<!-- MATH: $Is preferred?$ -->
<I>Is preferred</I>?) determines whether the system
should use the given phrase whenever referring to the term. It is asked
at the end of the lexification process, so that the phrasing reflects
the syntactic information that might have been determined from the other
questions (see section <A HREF="sme-lexwiz.html#denotational">3.3</A> below).

<P>

3.2 Proper Name Lexification
</H2>

<P>
Proper name lexification involves determining whether one of the
specialized proper-name predicates should be used, as appropriate for
the type of term being lexified. For example, for type of organisms
(i.e., #$OrganismClassificationType), the predicate for scientific
names (i.e.,#$scientificName) would be appropriate if the phrase
is the formal Latin name.

<P>
In addition, for certain types of terms, additional proper-name
assertions might be desired. For example, if a full name is given for a
person, it would be useful for the system to know the components of the
name (e.g., first, middle, and last). Similarly, if an long name is
entered, it might be useful for the user to enter an abbreviation.  In
both cases, the system will make a guess at the most likely values and
then have the user verify the information.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00033000000000000000">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="denotational">&#160;</A>
<BR>
3.3 Denotational Lexification
</H2>

<P>
``Denotational'' lexification involves selecting options needed for a
#$denotation or one of the multi-word lexification predicates
(e.g., #$multiWordString). Unlike proper-name mappings, which
usually just have a single form (i.e., the phrase itself), denotational
mappings can involve several variations of the phrase. For example,
since the verb ``gamble'' maps into #$Gambling, so do the verb
forms ``gambled' and ``gambling''. The variations usually occurs only
for a single word in the phrase, which can be viewed as being qualified
by the other words (i.e., the chief or head word).

<P>
Thus the relevant options for denotational mappings are as follows,
(where 'headword' refers to the word that is qualified):

<P>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3 BORDER="1">
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Headword position</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH=360>Position in the phrase of the headword (i.e.,
the word that determines the grammatic function of the entire phrase)</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">Headword part of speech</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH=360>Grammatical part of speech of the
headword (see #$SpeechPart).</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Often selecting between the simple noun and mass noun part of speech
choices (see #$SimpleNoun and #$MassNoun) is not
straightforward. For tips on making this decision, see the following sub-section,
<a href="./sme-lexwiz.html#SimpleMass">Simple versus Mass Nouns</a>.

<P>
After the choices have been made, there will be a verification step in
which all the variations for the phrase will be generated based on the
position of the headword and it's part of speech. This serves as an
important diagnostic as to whether the previous choices make sense for
the given mapping.

<P>

<h3><a name="SimpleMass">Simple versus Mass Nouns</a></h3>

In short, simple nouns are countable, whereas mass nouns are
uncountable.  To be more precise (borrowing definitions from
Merriam-Webster's International Dictionary):<br>
<br>
A simple noun is a noun (as bean or sheet) that forms a plural and is
used with a numeral, with words such as "many" or "few", or with the
indefinite article "a" or "an"<br>
<br>
A mass noun is a noun (as sand or water) that characteristically denotes
a homogeneous substance or a concept without subdivisions and that is
preceded in indefinite singular constructions by "some".<br>

<b>Notes</b>

1. In general, nouns tend to be simple nouns.

2. Often a mass nouns appear to occur in a countable usage, but usually
there an implicit mass usage intended.

   Simple?: I bought several acrylics.
   Mass: I bought several pieces of acrylics.

3. A few words fall under both categories. For instance "egg" has both
simple and mass noun usages:

   Simple:
   - I have three eggs
   - How many eggs do you want?

   Mass:
   - I have much egg on my face.
   - Do you want some egg on yours?

However, generally one usage is preferred over the other, such as the
simple noun sense of egg.

3.4 Relation Lexification
</H2>

<P>
During lexification of relation terms, the emphasis is not on how the
term itself is referred to but is instead on how assertions made using
the term can be paraphrased. This is done by asking the user for a
sample sentence or phrase using the relation. Then the correspondence of
words in the phrase to the relation's arguments are established.  Since
the relation paraphrasing also might involve variations based on the
argument, the parts of speech are checked as well.

           Specify the term and phrase for the lexical mapping

   Term :   AdHocUnit-Military________________________________
   Phrase : ad hoc unit - military______________________________________

   Reset OK

   Tip:

   Choose a phrase that clearly distinguishes the Cyc term in question,
   yet reflects common ways of referring to the term. However, it is
   important to avoid being overly specific as well as being overly
   general.

   For example, for the term 'MakingCoffee-TheBeverage', the phrase
   "making coffee beverage" is overly precise. Instead, "making coffee"
   is preferred since "coffee" in this case only refers to the beverage
   and not for instance to the beans or to grinds. In contrast, for the
   term 'Paint-Dry', "paint" would be overly general, since this can
   also refer to liquid paint as well. Instead "dry paint" would be
   preferrable.

   If you want to use more than one word or phrase to refer to the term,
   complete the wizard for the current term and then begin again with
   the same term but with a different word or phrase.

   Note that for relational terms, the phrase is just used to refer to
   the term itself. It is not the phrasing for paraphrases, which is
   specified in a subsequent form. For example, "liking the experience
   of" would be a good phrase for 'likesSensorially'.

   Checking whether the phrase is a proper name

   Is the phrase "ad hoc military unit" a name?
   Yes No

   Tip:

   Normally, capitalized phrases are proper names. Some lowercase
   phrases may be proper names as well; those which refer to specific
   people (e.g., "e. e. cummings") or entities (e.g., "priceline.com"),
   or those which are scientific names for specific organisms,
   compounds, etc. (e.g., "plexus brachialis"). But in most cases,
   lowercase phrases refer to classes of individuals and to concepts
   rather than to specific individuals.

   Example proper names (particular individuals):
               Mother Teresa
               IBM
               Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome

   Example common nouns or phrases (categories):

   Guessing the headword of the phrase

   Is "ad hoc military unit" a type of "unit"?
   Yes No

   Tip:

   The headword is the word that is being qualified by the other words in
   the phrase. It often indicates the general class of the concept
   described by the phrase. And, it determines the grammatic function of
   the phrase.

   For example, in the noun phrase "metal desk", the noun "desk" is the
   headword qualified by "metal". Similarly, the verb "sleeping" is the
   headword of the verb phrases "sleeping on the job" and "quietly sleeping".

   Tip:

   The main thing to check for is odd looking phrases, such as "loadings
   a weapon" as a variation of "loading a weapon". Note that there might
   not be variations. This may or may not be a problem, depending on the
   part of speech selected. For example, mass nouns like "sand" won't
