<p>

The <b>Domain Examples</b> tool provides a set of examples of uses of
predicates which are likely to be extremely useful for representing
knowledge in the topic under discussion.

<p>

You are strongly encouraged to familiarize yourself with the examples
provided by this tool as they are most likely to be the predicates you
will want to use.

<p>

The tool provides three powerful means of exploiting the examples :

<ol>
<li> Sorting based on several different sort methods </li>
<li> Filtering based on applicability to a concept </li>
<li> Suggesting sentence variations </li>
</ol>

Each will now be described in more detail.

<p><p>

<h3>Sort Methods</h3>

The examples can be sorted using several different methods, each of
which is more or less appropriate based on how you want to look for a
particular example.

<p>

When a sort method results in sections of predicates, an Index to all
the sections is available and is presented at the end of the page.

<p>

The links

<blockquote>
<b>[Top] [Start] [End] [Index]</b>
</blockquote>

allow you to jump about within the page to the top, the start of the
first example, the end of the last example, and the section index,
respectively.

<p>

Each of the sort methods is now described in more detail.

<dl>
<dt>
<b>topical utility</b>
</dt>
<dd>

This method sorts the examples based on the expected utility of their
predicates with respect to the topic under discussion.

<p>

In other words, predicates that are used more in microtheories
relevant to this topic of discussion will have their examples listed
earlier.  This is the default sort method.

<p><p>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>general utility</b>
</dt>
<dd>

This method sorts the examples based on the number of actual uses of
their predicates in the entire Cyc KB, not just the topic under
discussion.

<p>

In other words, predicates that are used more throughout the Cyc KB
will have their examples listed earlier.

<p><p>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>specificity</b>
</dt>
<dd>

This method sorts the examples based on the specificity of the most
restrictive argument constraint on their predicate.  If a filter term
is given, the sort is more precisely based on the most specific
constraint that admits the filter term.  The categories presented
represent the collections that constitute the relevant constraints.

<p>

In other words, predicates which more specifically apply to the given
search term will have their examples listed earlier.  <b>This is the best
sort method to use when a search term is given.</b>

<p><p>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>topical relevance</b>
</dt>
<dd>

This method sorts the examples based on how specific the definition of
the predicate is to the topic of discussion.  The categories presented
represent the microtheories in which the predicates are defined, and
are sorted from most specific (nearest to the topic of discussion) to
most general.

<p>

In other words, predicates which are defined to be more specific to
the topic will have their examples listed earlier.

<p><p>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>similarity</b>
</dt>
<dd>

This method sorts the examples based on the similarity of their
predicates.  The categories presented represent more general
predicates which are implied by all the predicates in the category.

<p>

In other words, predicates which share a common generalization will be
grouped together.  This method is good for seeing families of related
examples grouped together.

<p><p>
</dd>
<dt>
<b>alphabetically</b>
</dt>
<dd>

This method simply sorts all the examples alphabetically based on
their NL translation.  

<p><p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p><p>

<h3> Applicability Filtering </h3>

The most powerful way to exploit the domain examples is to select the
radio button for

<blockquote>
<b>Show examples applicable to</b>
</blockquote>

and enter a concept for which you'd like to find relevant applicable
examples.  The examples will then be narrowed down to just those
examples involving predicates that could be used on the given concept.
This works extremely well in connection with the "specificity" sort
method.

<p>

For this reason, it is often useful to start several Domain Examples
interactions that have their applicability filtered down to different
terms.

<p><p>

<h3> Sentence Variations </h3>

If an example has a <b>[Variations]</b> link provided, there are
several alternate forms of the example which can be presented for
possible use in cloning.  These all use the same predicate as the
given example, but provide several varieties of quantification.

<p>

Since the variations provided all show different possible
quantification options, they are most useful as starting points for
cloning rather than directly asserting.

<p>

Note that the Sentence Variations tool is also accessible from the
Assertion Clarifier page, whenever there are variations to present.
