<h3><a name="data">HL Data</a></h3>
<p>
The Assertion HL Data facility provides a Heuristic Level (HL) description of the selected assertion.  This page will be of most use to CYC&reg; System developers; for other users, most of the information on this page can be accessed by using the links from the Assertion Display Frame facility of the KB Browser.
<p>
The different display categories:
<ul>
<li><b>Assertion:</b> shows the assertion being described, in its HL (standard) form.
<li><b>ID Number:</b> shows the unique assertion ID number for the given assertion.
<li><b>HL CNF:</b> shows the assertion in HL form, converted to CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form).
<li><b>Mt:</b> shows the <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/mt-expansion-vocab.html#Microtheory>#$Microtheory</a> in which the assertion was asserted.
<li><b>Flags:</b> shows an integer which encodes three properties (GAF, Truth Value, Direction) of an assertion. 
<li><b>GAF?:</b> "True" if the assertion is a GAF (Ground Assertion Formula), "False" otherwise.
<li><b>Direction:</b> shows the assertion's direction, which can be Forward, Backward, or Code.
<li><b>Truth Value:</b> shows the truth value of the given assertion, which can be one of five values; e.g., "True (default)" means that the assertion is default true.
<li><b>Arguments:</b> lists the structures representing arguments for or against the given
assertion. 
<li><b>PList:</b> lists some of the rarely seen properties of assertions.  These 
include:
  <ul>
  <li>:VARIABLE-NAMES<br>
    a list of strings indicating names the user used for variables
  <li>:DEPENDENTS<br>
    a list of arguments which depend on the truth of this assertion
  <li>:INDEX<br>
    indexing for meta-assertions about this assertion (just like the
    index slot for constants)
  </ul>
</ul>
For more detailed explanations of assertions and their properties (e.g., truth value), read the <a href="../ref/cycl-syntax.html">Syntax of CycL</a>, as well as the <a href="cb-af.html">Assertion Display Frame Help</a>.
