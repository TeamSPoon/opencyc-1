Adding irregular nouns is similar to adding regular nouns, except
that you must specify all syntactic forms.  After specifying a word on
the main "Add To Lexicon" page, choose the "Add irregular strings to
lexicon" button and "Add Info".  After a new word is created, or
after entering an existing word, WALES will display the "Add Part of
Speech Forms" page.<p>

On this page, each part-of-speech form is followed by a series of boxes.
For the nouns, there are three boxes which designate the singular,
plural and mass forms.  Enter strings in their appropriate boxes.  Not
every form need be specified for each noun.  Some nouns only occur in
the mass form (e.g. "spaghetti"), some in all three forms (e.g.
"ham"), and others in some combination of the three forms.  As with
entering the regular nouns, you may feel that it is easier to enter all
related part-of-speech forms at this time.<p> 

When done, click on "Update Lexicon" and "Do It".  Once at the main
"Add to Lexicon" page, you follow the same steps in adding
denotations for irregular nouns as with regular nouns (by clicking on
"Add other lexical information").  Recall that denotations will appear
next to the "denotation-WSn" boxes, where "n" denotes the
word-sense number.<p>
