Each English word constant in the KB is named by a "root form".
This convention follows the structure of standard dictionaries which
group morphologically similar strings together. Because of this
convention, the same word constant is used to represent strings which
have many part-of-speech forms, as well as strings whose different
part-of-speech forms are morphologically similar. This grouping is
simply a matter of convenience and is not a claim for the derivational
morphology of any of the strings represented.<p>

For each morphological variant string associated with an instance of
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/linguistic-vocab.html#EnglishWord>#$EnglishWord</a>, there will be at least one assertion specifying a
denotation in the KB, i.e.  its semantic interpretation(s). <p>

Let's begin by adding a fictitious new word to the lexicon, "bliik",
a synonym for "parakeet".  To create a new word in the lexicon,
enter its root form in the box labeled: "Enter word".  For simple
nouns, the root form is <a href="../vocab/lexicon-vocab.html#singular">singular</a>.  In our
example, "bliik" is the root form.<p>

Next, select the "Add regular strings to lexicon" button and press
"Add Info".  Recall that a noun is  regular if its plural is formed by
adding an "s" or an "es" to its stem.<p>

Since no constant for the word "bliik" previously existed in CYC&reg;,
WALES displays the "Create New Word Unit" page.  If "bliik" was
already in the lexicon, then WALES would ask whether you wanted to add
information to the existing word unit, or to create a new one .<p>

To create the new constant, press the "Create" button on the "Create
New Word Unit" page.  You can modify the name of the word unit, if
necessary, by first editing the word unit that is in the "Unit name:"
box and then by pressing the "Create" button.  If you make a mistake,
the "Reset" button will reset the word unit in the box to its original
form. After pressing the "Create" button, WALES will display the "Add
Part of Speech Forms" page.<p> 

At the "Noun Form sing" box, enter the <a
href="../vocab/lexicon-vocab.html#singular">singular</a> form. You
need only to fill out this box, as the parser recognizes plural forms of
regular strings.  If there are other part-of-speech forms that you want
to link to this constant, you may enter those at this time.  Click on
the "Update Lexicon" button and then "Do It".<p> 

At this point, WALES returns you to the original "Add to CYC&reg; Lexicon"
page.  The root string of the word you just created will remain in the
box so that you can easily move to a page to add its denotation with
minimal typing.  You will also notice that throughout this process, the
word unit that you created will be present on the pages as a clickable
link to its representation in the KB.  As soon as your operations are
processed, you should see all of your word unit assertions represented
in the KB. <p>

After your string assertions are made, you will need to add denotations
for your strings.  First, click on the  "Add Other Lexical
Information" button and then "Add Info".  Using WALES, denotation
assertions may only be added to one part of speech at a time.  In this
example, since there is only one part of speech already specified for
the word constant, WALES will display the "Denotation Entry" page.  Had
more than one part of speech been specified for "Bliik-TheWord", then
the user would be prompted to which part of speech s/he intends to use.<p>

On the "Denotation Entry" page you will see boxes which contain the
denotations for various word senses.  Since our example is a newly
created word, all boxes should be blank. For general guidelines on
selecting an appropriate denotation, see the "WALES User's Guide".
In this case, we want "bliik" to denote the CYC&reg; constant Parakeet,
so enter "Parakeet" into a denotation box.<p>

After you have typed your denotations in the appropriate boxes, click
on the "Update Lexicon" button.  If you make a mistake, you can
always click on the "Restore Values" button, which will restore the
information in the boxes to their original values.<p>

The CYC&reg; NL system requires that all word senses have <i>some</i>
denotation which reflects their meaning, even in cases where a more
complicated semantic translation rule will be needed to fully express
the meaning. In such cases, the denotation of a word sense will be a
CYC&reg; constant which is close in meaning to the word, or which captures
some aspect of that word's meaning. The actual word meaning is
specified with a semantic translation rule. For example, the noun form
of "anchorwoman" denotes #$Anchorperson. The fact that an anchorwoman
is an anchorperson who is also female is captured with a
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/lexicon-vocab.html#nounSemTrans>#$nounSemTrans</a> rule.<p>
