What makes a good denotation?  A good denotation is one that best
approximates the "meaning" of the particular word sense you are trying
to capture.  It may resemble the word unit in appearance, but often the
best denotation will differ in morphology.  (Consider word unit
"Talk-TheWord" with denotation-WS0 "Speaking".)  A good denotation will
strike the right balance between too general and too specific.  (For
example, <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#Automobile>#$Automobile</a> is not a good denotation for "vehicle", since
bikes and trucks are also vehicles.)  If you are in doubt about the
different possible denotations of a word unit, Webster's is again a
recommended resource.  If you are unable to hook up the word unit with a
constant in the KB, you should write an appropriate SemTrans rule.  If
this is not possible, send a note to someone on the CYC&reg; NL team, who
will either find an appropriate denotation, or fill a potential gap in
the KB. <p>
One final note on denotations: many verbs can be used with prepostions
(e.g. "board up", "take off").  These will be taken care of by the CYC&reg;
NL team.  Do not write a separate denotation for each instance of a
given verb with a different preposition.
