A collection of collections is "sibling-disjoint" if it is an
instance of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#SiblingDisjointCollection>#$SiblingDisjointCollection</a>.  (A more general but much
less common collection is #$SiblingDisjointSetOrCollection.)  If
#$MyDisjointType is an instance of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#SiblingDisjointCollection>#$SiblingDisjointCollection</a>, then
each instance of #$MyDisjointType is mutually disjoint with all the
other instances.  In cases where the disjoining collection would have
many instances, this is much more manageable and economical than
making a large number of assertions involving <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#disjointWith>#$disjointWith</a>.<p>

An exception to the disjoin is the case where one disjoined collection
is a subset of another.  In that case, a term may be an instance of
both collections. Consider the following example:<p>

<img src="../img/sib-disjoint.gif"><p>

The constant R may not be an instance of both A and B because A and B
are both instances of #$MyDisjointType.  S, however, may be an
instance of both B and C, since (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genls>#$genls</a> C B) is true.<p>

#$DayOfWeekType is a good example of an instance of
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#SiblingDisjointCollection>#$SiblingDisjointCollection</a>.  Its instances include terms like
#$Friday and #$Saturday.  Any particular day could be an instance of
#$Friday or #$Saturday, but not both.
