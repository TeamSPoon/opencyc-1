A Cyc&reg; Server is a Cyc executable image running on some machine.  In
principle, more than one Cyc Server could be running on a machine, but
the software currently assumes that there is only one per machine.<p>

At a site using Cyc, the Cyc Servers share changes to their KB's by
recording the operations in common transcript files.  Cyc Servers
which start with the same KB and which process the same set of
operations ought to end with identical KBs.<p>

This "loosely-coupled" multiple-server scheme allows many users to
edit a shared knowledge base while retaining the advantages of using
local copies of the data, such as good response time.  It also
provides the flexibility to perform local experiments without
affecting other users.  It's possible for two users to share operations
which become contradictory when merged in the common transcript, but
this happens infrequently and is not typically a problem in daily
usage.<p>

More than one user can be logged in to a Cyc Server via the Cyc Web
Interface.  In that case, the users need to cooperate carefully since
they are all working in the same image and each can change system
parameters that will affect the others.  At Cycorp, there is typically
one primary user for each Cyc Server, and that person is the one who
may edit its KB.  Others may log in and browse that copy of the KB,
but they should only edit or modify system parameters with the
permission of the primary user.<p>

Usually, one Cyc Server is chosen to maintain the "reference" copy
of the KB and at intervals its entire KB is written out to files.  From
the KB files, new executable images can be generated, incorporating
all the changes from the old shared transcript.<p>
