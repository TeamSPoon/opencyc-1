<hr>
In many cases, proper nouns can be represented with a single nameString
assertion, rather than with a separate word unit. If you want to enter
a proper noun which would only have a singular form, and which has no
peculiar syntactic features, you can use nameString. For example, the
proper name "Cycorp" has only a singular form, and denotes Cycorp,
so it is a good candidate for a nameString assertion. On the other
hand, "Rockies" as a string denoting the RockyMountains should be
represented with a word unit, since we want to assert the plural form
only, and also assert that "Rockies" prefers to be preceded by the definite determiner.<p>

To add a nameString assertion, type the proper noun you want to enter
in the box. You will probably want to capitalize it as it usually
appears in text. Click on the "Add a proper name string" button. On
the next page, you will be prompted to enter a CYC&reg; constant as a
denotation for the string. The "C" beside the typein box can be used
for constant completion. Just type in the beginning of a constant name (e.g. "Rock", click on the "C", and a list of possible completions will pop up..)
