Direction is a value attached to every assertion which determines
whether inferencing involving the assertion is done at assert time or
at ask time. There are two possible values for direction: <b>:forward</b>
(inferencing done at assert time) and <b>:backward</b> (inferencing done at
ask time).<p>

Any Cyc formula which begins with <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a> (a rule)
defaults to direction <b>:backward</b>.  All other assertions default
to direction <b>:forward</b>.<p>

<tt>[Change Direction]</tt> may be used to change the direction of an
assertion.  When you click <tt>[Change Direction]</tt>, it prompts for the
new direction. When you click the "Change Direction" button, the interface
queues the operations to unassert the old assertion and reassert it
with the new direction.<p>

The most common reason to change the direction of an assertion is to
make a rule <b>:forward</b>.  When a rule is <b>:backward</b>, it is
only considered when the KB is queried with backward inference
allowed. But when a rule is made <b>:forward</b>, inference is
immediately performed to draw conclusions based on that rule and
relevant GAFs in the KB.  Whenever forward assertions are made, forward
rules are tested to see if they are applicable.<p>

Backward GAFs are exactly analogous to backward rules: they are not
used in forward inference. So if you change the direction of some GAF
to <b>:backward</b>, it will not be considered at the time of any 
subsequent assertions, only during queries which allow backward inference.
This is currently rare in the Cyc KB, but it can be used in cases
where the cyclist wishes to suppress forward inference in particular
cases.
