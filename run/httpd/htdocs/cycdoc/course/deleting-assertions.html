To remove an assertion, display it and simply click on <tt>[Unassert]</tt>.
An FI-UNASSERT operation is immediately added to the local queue and the
interface displays a page confirming the action.<p>

Try deleting <tt>(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> &lt;your constant&gt; #$Zoologist)</tt>, then
reload your constant and verify that the deletion occured.<p>

You will also see the command <tt>[Blast]</tt>, which will queue an
operation calling FI-BLAST on the assertion.  FI-BLAST is typically
used only by experienced cyclists, but it is documented here for
completeness.<p>

For an assertion which was directly entered into the KB (by FI-ASSERT
or some comparable operation), FI-BLAST achieves the same result as
FI-UNASSERT: the assertion is removed from the KB.<p>

But FI-BLAST can also remove propositions which result from inference.
(FI-BLAST P), where P is some proposition, removes both P and its
supports, the internal structures describing the logical arguments
which conclude P.  In short, "blasting" an assertion P is guaranteed
to change the KB to a state where P is not known to be true. It does
not, however, remove any other propositions from the KB, so P may
still be implicit in the KB.  For example, consider the following
situation<p>

<pre>
     (#$citizenOf #$Fred <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/hormuz-area-vocab.html#France>#$France</a>)
     (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a> (#$citizenOf ?X <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/hormuz-area-vocab.html#France>#$France</a>) 
                       (#$feelsTowardObject ?X #$EiffelTower <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/emotion-vocab.html#Pride>#$Pride</a>))
</pre>
from which
<pre>
     (#$feelsTowardObject #$Fred #$EiffelTower <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/emotion-vocab.html#Pride>#$Pride</a>)
</pre><p>

was concluded.  If we blast that conclusion, it does not remove either
of the two propositions which led to it.  An appropriate
query, such as asking<p>

<pre>
     (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/emotion-vocab.html#feelsTowardsObject>#$feelsTowardsObject</a> #$Fred #$EiffelTower ?X)
</pre><p>

should draw the same conclusion again.<p>

<tt>[Blast]</tt> should be used with caution. It is sometimes useful
in recovering from invalid states.  Or you might want to undo the
conclusions resulting from asking a query that invoked backwards
inference.
