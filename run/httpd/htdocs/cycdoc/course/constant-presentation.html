The assertions involving <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/state-change-vocab.html#TeethCleaning>#$TeethCleaning</a> are organized into several
sections some of which already will appear in the right frame, but all
the sections may be found by following their links in the left frame:<p>

<b>Documentation</b><p>
This section includes documentation and system-related
assertions, such as those using <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/doc-vocab.html#comment>#$comment</a> and <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/doc-vocab.html#myCreationTime>#$myCreationTime</a>.<p>

<b>Definitional Info</b><p>

Assertions that most fundamentally define <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/state-change-vocab.html#TeethCleaning>#$TeethCleaning</a>'s role in
the KB are listed in this section. This includes <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> and <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genls>#$genls</a>
assertions.  When the browser displays predicates or functions, their
arity and argument types also go in this section.<p>

<b>Lexical Info</b><p>

This section contains lexical information, including any <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/lexicon-vocab.html#denotation>#$denotation</a>
links and part-of-speech information.<p>

<b>Applicable Relations</b><p>

All predicates which can apply to the displayed constant (via some
argument) are displayed here.  That is, the constant meets the argNisa
(where N is currently 1-5) constraint of the relation.<p>

<b>All Assertions</b><p>
This section has a complete listing of all assertions which involve
the displayed constant.  The total number is listed in parentheses.<p>

<b>All GAF's</b><p>
This section lists all ground atomic formulas (GAF's) involving the
displayed constant.  The number of GAF's that will be displayed is
given in parentheses.<p>

<b>Arg: 1</b>, <b>Arg: 2</b>, etc.<p>

In the <b>Arg: 1</b> section, <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/state-change-vocab.html#TeethCleaning>#$TeethCleaning</a> is the first argument in
each assertion; in the <b>Arg: 2</b> section, it is the second argument,
and so on.<p>

<b>Predicate Extent</b><p>
This section applies only to relations.  Clicking on this link will
display all assertions in which the displayed constant is in the 0th
argument position (e.g., (constant x y)).  Since <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/state-change-vocab.html#TeethCleaning>#$TeethCleaning</a> is
not used as a predicate, you won't see this link.<p>

<b>Antecedent</b><p>

Here, the displayed constant appears in axioms that use <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a>.
In these rules, the constant appears in the antecedent of the rule.<p>

<b>Consequent</b><p>In this section, the displayed constant appears in the consequent of the <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a> rules.<p>

<b>Microtheory Contents</b><p>
This section is only available if the displayed constant is a
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/mt-expansion-vocab.html#Microtheory>#$Microtheory</a>.  Since <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/state-change-vocab.html#TeethCleaning>#$TeethCleaning</a> is not a <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/mt-expansion-vocab.html#Microtheory>#$Microtheory</a>, you
won't see this section here.  All assertions in the microtheory may be
displayed by selecting this link.<p> 


<b>Miscellaneous</b><p>

This section contains all other references to the displayed constant
that are not covered in the previous categories.<p> 

Other links in the left frame may appear as subcategories within some
of these main categories.  These links work mainly as would be expected, by refining
those things displayed in the main categories.  For instance,
predicate names may appear under <b>Arg 1</b>, and clicking on the
predicate names will display uses of that predicate that contain the
displayed constant in the Arg 1 position.  If microtheories appear as
subcategories, then clicking on it will display the same items as the
main category, but restricted to only those assertions that are in
that microtheory.<p>
