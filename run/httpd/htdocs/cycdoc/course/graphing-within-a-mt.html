When you graph assertions within a particular
microtheory, you need to make one additional choice:
should assertions in the base microtheories also be included?<p>

The geography microtheories provide an example: #$UnitedStatesGeographyMt has
#$WorldGeographyMt as a base, i.e. whatever is true in
#$WorldGeographyMt is true in #$UnitedStatesGeographyMt.<p>

Check the option "Use its genl mts too, if possible" and graph with the following 
parameters:<p>

<pre>
    Starting Terme: ContinentOfNorthAmerica
     Microtheory: UnitedStatesGeographyMt
     Binary Predicate: geographicalSubRegions<p>
</pre><p>If your copy of OpenCyc had detailed information on geography, the resulting graph would include subregions of the continental United States, such as #$Maine-State.<a href="#note">*</a><p>Return to the Hierarcy Browser page and try the graph again with the genl mts option turned off. The new graph will omit the assertions which are not in the #$UnitedStatesGeographyMt, so you won't see information about any other countries. It may be surprising not to have any information about the #$ContiguousUnitedStates (lower 48), however the assertion that that is a geographical subregion of North America is in the WorldGeographyMt, not in the UnitedStatesGeographyMt. As a result, all that would appear is #$Alaska-State and all the <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/spatial-vocab.html#geographicalSubRegions>#$geographicalSubRegions</a> thereof.

To display the Mt of each assertion in the hierarchy, click on the button
"Show assertion's mts after terms".

<a name="note">*</a>
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/hormuz-area-vocab.html#UnitedStatesOfAmerica>#$UnitedStatesOfAmerica</a> is not a subregion of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/geography-vocab.html#ContinentOfNorthAmerica>#$ContinentOfNorthAmerica</a>
since Hawaii is not in North America. This is a gray area, since the US is <i>mostly</i> a North American subregion. If it became an important issue, alternative microtheories with different assumptions could be developed.<p>
