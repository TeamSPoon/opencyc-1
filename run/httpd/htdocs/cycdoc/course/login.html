<hr>First of all, let's be clear that we're talking about logging in to the <b>OpenCyc&reg; Server</b>, <b>not</b> the machine on which the OpenCyc&reg Server is
running.  The purpose of logging into an OpenCyc&reg; Server is to identify the
instance of #$Cyclist which represents the author of operations
generated by the interface. Whenever a WWW connection is made to an OpenCyc&reg;
Server, all operations must be associated with some #$Cyclist.<p>Go to the top frame of the interface and click on &quot;Login&quot;, and the Login Area page will be displayed. The page will tell you who you are currently logged in as, and any others who are logged into the same OpenCyc&reg; Server.<p>Unless someone has already logged in to this OpenCyc&reg; Server from your web browser, the cyclist should be #$Guest. #$Guest is an instance of #$Cyclist which is treated specially by the system: while logged in as #$Guest, you may not perform editing operations or other actions which could modify the KB. <p>

At a given site, the people who edit the KB are represented in the KB
as instances of #$Cyclist (and, one would hope, as instances of
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Person>#$Person</a> and other relevant collections).<p>

If there is an OpenCyc&reg; constant which represents you, you can log into a
OpenCyc&reg; Server from the Login Area page by entering the name of your
constant and clicking the "Submit" button. The KB editing facilities
are then enabled and any OpenCyc&reg; operations which you originate will be tagged as
yours.
		<p>

For example, if Mary Jones is represented by the constant #$MaryJones,
she can log in by typing "MaryJones" (no "#$") in the input field
and clicking "Login".
		<p>If you are initially logged in as #$Guest, you'll need to find someone who already has their own OpenCyc&reg; constant who can login first and assist you, since #$Guest does not have KB editing privileges. New OpenCyc 
images (KBs) come with only one login name other than #$Guest, and that is #$CycAdministrator. Log in to this 
account in order to then create other #$Cyclist accounts.
		<p>The changes that you make to the KB on your OpenCyc&reg; Server are not automatically shared with other OpenCyc&reg; Servers, or recorded in the &quot;official&quot; KB maintained at your site. For example, if someone who already had a Cyc constant created your constant for you, and you wanted it to become part of the site KB, you would have to explicitly instruct the OpenCyc&reg; Server to share its operations.
