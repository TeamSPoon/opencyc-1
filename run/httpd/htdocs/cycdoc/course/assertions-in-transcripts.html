Lets look at how your operations were recorded in the transcript.  Go
to the bottom frame and click on "System".<p>  

Additional information is added when the operation is saved to the transcript, so
let's look at the contents of the local transcript:<p>

Click on the hyper link after <b> Write Transcript: </b> to display that file.
The most recent operations are at the end of the file. Here's an
example of the resulting operations if the cyclist was #$Natasha, the
Cyc Server was "cyc-server", and the date was March 12, 1996:<p>

<pre>
     ((:HP "Natasha" 201285) "cyc-server" 19960312 
       (FI-ASSERT 
       '(
	 (:HP "isa" 260) 
	   (:HP "Natasha" 201285) 
	   (:HP "Doctor-Medical" 27477)) 
       '(:HP "BaseKB" 273) ':DEFAULT ':FORWARD))

     ((:HP "Natasha" 201285) "cyc-server" 19960312 
       (FI-TIMESTAMP-ASSERTION 
       '(:HP "Natasha" 201285) '19960312))
</pre><p>

The first thing that you should notice is that the constants are
referred to with expressions containing 3 items: ":HP", the constant
name, and a number which is that constant's internal id. These are
called "encapsulated" constants (explained below). Lets "unencapsulate" the 
constants and generally make the expressions more readable:<p>

<pre>
     (#$Natasha cyc-server 19960312 
       (FI-ASSERT '(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> #$Natasha <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/medical-vocab.html#Doctor-Medical>#$Doctor-Medical</a>)
                   <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/mt-vocab.html#BaseKB>#$BaseKB</a> 
                   :DEFAULT 
                   :FORWARD))

     (#$Natasha cyc-server 19960312 
       (FI-TIMESTAMP-ASSERTION #$Natasha 19960312))
</pre><p>

So each operation has the form:

<pre>
     (&lt;undefined&gt; &lt;originating-cyc-server&gt; &lt;date&gt; &lt;fi-operation&gt;)
</pre><p>

The first item, <tt>&lt;undefined&gt;</tt>, used to be the cyclist's
constant, but it is not currently defined. Although it is often the
cyclist's constant, it may have other values and should not be relied
on. Ignore it.<p>

<tt>&lt;fi-operation&gt;</tt> is a call to one of the functions
of the Cyc Functional Interface, the application program interface (API)
for Cyc.<p>

The first operation is obviously the assertion that we entered.  But
what is the second operation which calls FI-TIMESTAMP-ASSERTION?<p>

FI-TIMESTAMP-ASSERTION puts an explicit date and author on an
assertion. Cyc assertions made via the Cyc Web Interface are always
performed as a pair of operations, one to do the assertion and the
other to annotate it.<p>

Notice that FI-TIMESTAMP-ASSERTION does not refer to the assertion
directly, but depends on the cyc-server to have recorded the
last assertion.  In the unusual case that transcripts are
edited by hand, care must be taken to keep timestamping operations
immediately after the operations to which they refer.<p>

<hr>

We need to encapsulate constants with a unique and unchanging id
number because constants can be renamed.  Suppose a Cyc Server is
processing a long sequence of operations from other Cyc Servers. From
Server-A comes an operation that renames #$Constant1 to #$Constant2,
but close behind it comes an operation from Server-B, making an
assertion involving #$Constant1.  Clearly, it is better for the
assertion to be made on the intended constant, despite the rename,
than to get an error.<p>

Incidentally, the ":HP" doesn't stand for "Hewlett-Packard", but
for "Hash-Percent".  Cyc constants used to be prefixed with "#%"
instead of "#$", so at the time this convention was devised we chose
":HP" as the marker for encapsulated constant expressions.
