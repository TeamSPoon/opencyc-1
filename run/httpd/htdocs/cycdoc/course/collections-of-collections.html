There are cases where it is useful to make assertions about a class of
collections, so we can reify these classes as constants which are
collections of collections.  These constants are both instances of
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Collection>#$Collection</a> and subsets of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Collection>#$Collection</a>, since all their instances
are also instances of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Collection>#$Collection</a>.<p>

<img src="../img/col-of-col.gif"><p>

Collections of collections have many uses; a common use is to
constrain the domain of some predicate which applies to collections.
For example,<p>

<pre>
     (#$concentration #$PortionOfLemonade001 #$Sucrose (#$GramsPerMilliliter 0.1))
</pre><p>

states that in the particular instance of lemonade,
#$PortionOfLemonade001, the concentration of #$Sucrose is 0.1 g/ml.
The second argument in an assertion involving #$concentration is a
collection, not an individual.  But clearly, not just any
collection could make sense in that role. For example,<p>

<pre>
     (#$concentration #$PortionOfLemonade001 <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/math-vocab.html#Integer>#$Integer</a> (#$GramsPerMilliliter 0.1))
</pre><p>

is an assertion which the KB should reject as meaningless.  This can
be accomplished using the collection of collections
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/composition-vocab.html#TangibleStuffCompositionType>#$TangibleStuffCompositionType</a>, which has #$Sucrose as one of its many
instances. The assertion<p>

<pre>
     (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#arg2Isa>#$arg2Isa</a> #$concentration <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/composition-vocab.html#TangibleStuffCompositionType>#$TangibleStuffCompositionType</a>)
</pre><p>

enforces the minimal constraint that #$concentration can only refer to
kinds of tangible stuff in its second argument.<p>

If you examine #$Sucrose, you may notice that not only is it an
instance of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/composition-vocab.html#TangibleStuffCompositionType>#$TangibleStuffCompositionType</a>, it is also a subset of
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/top-vocab.html#TangibleThing>#$TangibleThing</a>.  Why do we have both <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/top-vocab.html#TangibleThing>#$TangibleThing</a> and
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/composition-vocab.html#TangibleStuffCompositionType>#$TangibleStuffCompositionType</a>?  The answer is that not all
collections which are subsets of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/top-vocab.html#TangibleThing>#$TangibleThing</a> are instances of
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/composition-vocab.html#TangibleStuffCompositionType>#$TangibleStuffCompositionType</a>.  This reflects the fact that there are
distinctions between things which are more "stuff-like" in some
aspects and more "object-like" in others.  We use type collections to
express these distinctions.<p>

For example, although <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#Automobile>#$Automobile</a> is a subset of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/top-vocab.html#TangibleThing>#$TangibleThing</a>,
(any automobile is also a tangible thing), it would be unreasonable to
assert:<p>

<pre>
     (#$concentration #$PortionOfLemonade001 <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#Automobile>#$Automobile</a> (#$GramsPerMilliliter 0.1))
</pre><p>

This is enforced because <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#Automobile>#$Automobile</a> is not an instance of
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/composition-vocab.html#TangibleStuffCompositionType>#$TangibleStuffCompositionType</a>.<p>

(Although one might use the English phrase, "the concentration of
automobiles in the city...", the word "concentration" in that
phrase is being used with a different (though analogous) meaning and
would not be translated to an expression involving #$concentration.)<p>

We'll return to the issue of constraining the arguments of predicates
in the <a href="argument-types.html">"Argument Types of
Predicates"</a> section.<p>

Another use of collections of collections is to provide additional
structure to the genls hierarchy.  For example, there are many ways we
could divide <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/top-vocab.html#TangibleThing>#$TangibleThing</a> up into subsets (that is,
"subcollections").  One way is to identify subsets which are
characterized by some intrinsic material composition shared by their
elements.  These are subsets of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/top-vocab.html#TangibleThing>#$TangibleThing</a>, and elements of
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/composition-vocab.html#TangibleStuffCompositionType>#$TangibleStuffCompositionType</a>.  Another way is to identify subsets
which are characterized by some physical state of matter shared by
their elements.  These are subsets of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/top-vocab.html#TangibleThing>#$TangibleThing</a>, and elements of
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/material-vocab.html#TangibleStuffStateType>#$TangibleStuffStateType</a>.
