Now that we've covered transcripts and communication modes, we're ready
to modify the KB. Make sure that you are either the sole user of the Cyc Server
or that you are cooperating with the other users.  Set your communication 
mode to <b>:isolated</b> and make sure that the agenda is enabled.

Click on the name of your constant in the top frame. 
The constant will be displayed on a browsing page in the center frames.
We'll add and edit assertions on this constant.

Next to each assertion is a <a
href="more-assertions-info.html"> truth-value symbol</a>
which is also a clickable link representing the assertion.  On the
assertion which looks like:<p>

<pre>
     isa :  <img src="../img/cb/yellow.gif">HumanCyclist  
</pre><p>

click on the <img src="../img/cb/yellow.gif">.  The web interface will display a page
showing the assertion in proposition syntax and presenting a set of
editing options.<p>

Now, we don't really want to change this assertion, since the cyclist
logged in should be an instance of #$Cyclist.  So lets add a new
assertion that we can experiment with:<p>

Click on "<tt>[Assert Similar]</tt>" and a new page will display the
assertion in an editing pane.  You are probably wondering why there
isn't a command "<tt>[New]</tt>" which would bring up a blank
editing window.  The reason is that your new assertion often shares at
least one term with the one you were browsing, so this behavior is
usually more convenient. If you want to enter a completely
different assertion, all you have to do is delete the line before you
start typing.<p>

Change the assertion from<p>

<pre>
     (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> &lt;your constant&gt; #$HumanCyclist)
</pre><p>

to<p>

<pre>
     (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> &lt;your constant&gt; <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/medical-vocab.html#Doctor-Medical>#$Doctor-Medical</a>)
</pre><p>
 
and click the "Assert Formula" button.  The assertion is added
to your local queue and the interface displays a page confirming
that the operation was added.<p>

Use your browsers "Back" button <i>three times</i> to return to the 
page displaying your constant, then click the "Reload/Refresh" button
to get the latest information from your Cyc Server.  If your Cyc Server
was not busy, your new assertion has probably already been added, and
your constant is now an instance of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/medical-vocab.html#Doctor-Medical>#$Doctor-Medical</a>.  If not, wait 
a moment and hit "Reload/Refresh" again.  You should see that the number of 
operations in your transcript file has increased by <i>two</i> (not one,
as we'll see in a moment).<p>
