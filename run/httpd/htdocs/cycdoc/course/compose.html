<hr>

On the CYC&reg; Navigator page, click <b><tt>[Compose KE Text]</tt></b> to go to the page for the
Compose facility.

On the Compose page, you can enter KE Text expressions in a large
input pane. Clicking the "Eval" button submits the completed
expressions to the KE Text processor.<p> 

<b>Note:</b>
<blockquote>
Before you can modify the KB, you must be logged in to the CYC&reg; Server.
See <a href="../course/login.html">CYC&reg; Login</a> to learn how.
Furthermore, you should be sure that you will not be interfering with 
other users (if any) of the CYC&reg; Server Machine and that your operations
are recorded to the appropriate transcript (if any).  See <a
href="../course/managing-operations.html">Managing CYC&reg; Operations</a>
for details. Be sure that you are in the right mode for doing exercises
before proceeding.
</blockquote>

The KE Text processor will parse your KE Text and display its results 
on a new web page before making any changes to the KB.<p>

If it finds syntactic errors in your expressions, these will be
reported. You can go back to the Compose page to correct them and try
again.<p>

If it finds that you have referred to constants which 
do not yet exist, it will display a page which lists the proposed 
new constants.  If you do <b>not</b> want to create some of the new
constants (for example, any due to typing errors), return to the
Compose page to edit the KE text. If you want to create them, click
"create", and constant creation operations will be queued.<p>

The KE Text processor displays a "waiting page" after it queues the
operations. The waiting page is an unfortunate consequence of the
basic CGI protocol used by the CYC&reg; Web Interface: the server can only
respond to the client's requests, so it can't take the initiative to
keep you informed of the status of the operations.  Instead, you have
to wait a little and then request an update.<a href="#note">*</a><p>

If the constants have not yet been created, you will get the wait page
again (but with updated status information). If the constants have
been created, then the KE text processor will display the next page,
showing the sequence of proposed operations derived from the input
text.<p>

When the KE Text expressions parse without error and all the new
constants (if any) have been created, it will display a new page
showing the proposed changes as a sequence of FI operations.  If you click "Eval Forms", the operations will be queued for
processing on the CYC&reg; Server Machine, and a notification page will
confirm that the forms were evaluated.

<a name="note">*</a> At some point, the interface may be upgraded to
take advantage of applet protocols such as Java.  Cycorp policy,
however, is to remain focused on core CYC&reg; development and not allow
the work on interfaces to become an end in itself.
