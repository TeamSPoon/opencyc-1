The CYC&reg; KB is a set of assertions about the world.  Those
assertions may be stated as expressions in CycL, the CYC&reg;
representation language. The terms of CycL expressions can be
variables, certain kinds of objects native to the computational
substrate (such as strings or integers), or CYC&reg; constants.  CYC&reg
contains objects in the KB which are created to denote
particular concepts.  They have unique names and are written with the
prefix "#$".<p>

CYC&reg; constants can either denote sets, like "the set of all people",
or individuals, like "the Eiffel Tower".  Every term in CYC&reg;
is an element of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Thing>#$Thing</a>, the universal set.  <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Thing>#$Thing</a> is partitioned
into <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Individual>#$Individual</a> and <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/math-vocab.html#SetOrCollection>#$SetOrCollection</a>. <p>

<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Individual>#$Individual</a> denotes the set of all things which are not sets.
Individuals in the CYC&reg; KB include constants such as
#$CityOfSanFrancisco and #$JimmyCarter.<p>

<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/math-vocab.html#SetOrCollection>#$SetOrCollection</a> is partitioned into <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/math-vocab.html#Set-Mathematical>#$Set-Mathematical</a> and
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Collection>#$Collection</a>.  The distinction between mathematical sets and
collections in CYC&reg; is an important one.  Both sets and collections can have
elements.  Thus, they can both enter into set-theoretic relations like
"subset" and "superset". <p>

The difference between <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Collection>#$Collection</a> and <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/math-vocab.html#Set-Mathematical>#$Set-Mathematical</a> is that
sets, in the mathematical sense, are defined
<strong>extensionally</strong> -- that is, by their members.  Two sets
that have the same members are equivalent.  CYC&reg; collections, on the
other hand, are defined <strong>intensionally</strong>, by their
<i>criteria</i> for membership.  So in CYC&reg;,
#$USPresidentsNamedRoosevelt,
#$USPresidentsWhoWereEachOthersFifthCousins, and
#$TheFirstTwoUSPresidentsWhoseLastNamesBeginWithR would all be
different <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Collection>#$Collection</a>s, even though they are all comprised of exactly
the same elements as the mathematical set {Theodore Roosevelt,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt}. <p>

In CYC&reg;, collections are much more important, and much more commonly
used, than sets.  The criteria for membership in a <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Collection>#$Collection</a> need
not be stated explicitly in the KB.  Collections in the CYC&reg; KB include
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Dog>#$Dog</a> (the collection of all dogs), <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/math-vocab.html#RealNumber>#$RealNumber</a> (the collection of
all real numbers), and <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/financial-vocab.html#Buying>#$Buying</a> (the collection of all buying
events).<p>

Membership in a collection is typically expressed as "instance of"
or "element of" or "is a", as in "Fred is an instance of the
collection <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Person>#$Person</a>," or "Fred is an element of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Person>#$Person</a>," or
"Fred is a <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Person>#$Person</a>." If the terms "subset" and "superset" are
used with reference to collections, they typically are intended to
mean "more specific collection" and "more general collection",
respectively.<p>
